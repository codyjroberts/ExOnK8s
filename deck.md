# What we'll cover

* Containerizing Elixir with Docker
* Distillery
* Multi-stage Docker builds
* Overview of basic Kubernetes resources
* Deploying Elixir to Kubernetes
* Interacting with our running application

---

# What we won't

* Anything in great detail
* Hot upgrades
* Clustering elixir nodes
* Operating at Pokemon Go scale

---

# Why deploy Elixir on Kubernetes?

* Horizontal and vertical autoscaling
* Service discovery
* Your employer already uses or wants to use Kubernetes

---

# Introducing Containers

> A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, executable package of a piece of software that includes everything needed to run it: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, settings.
-- [docker.com](https://www.docker.com/what-container)

---

### Containers
# Popular flavors

* docker
* rkt

---

### Docker
# A simple example

```
FROM bitwalker/alpine-elixir:1.5.2

EXPOSE 4001

ADD mix.exs mix.lock ./
RUN mix do deps.get, deps.compile

COPY config ./config
COPY lib ./lib
COPY priv ./priv
```

### Docker
# Show & Tell

---

# Introducing Distillery

> A pure-Elixir, dependency-free implementation of release generation for Elixir projects.
-- [bitwalker/distillery](https://github.com/bitwalker/distillery)

---

### Distillery
# Why use releases?

* Eager loading
* No development dependencies included
* Hooks and commands make it easy to run migrations

---

### Distillery
# Configuring the release

* Add distillery to your deps
  * `{:distillery, "~> 1.4", runtime: false}`
* Initialize
  * `mix release.init`
* Configure
  * `vi rel/config.exs`

---

### Distillery
# Show & Tell

---

### Distillery
# Bundling the release

* Goals:
  * Build anywhere
  * Release only (no dev dependencies)

---

### Distillery & Docker
# Multi-stage builds

* Introduced in Docker v17.05
* Allows sharing of files between images during build process

---

### Distillery & Docker
# Show & Tell

---

# Introducing Kubernetes

> Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
-- [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io)

---

### Kubernetes
# Pods

* One (typically) or more containers
* Containers share the same linux namespace
  * network -- routing table,  network interfaces, ...
  * UTS -- same hostname
  * PID -- coming soon?
* Can share volumes
  * pod (not container) lifetime
  * volumes can be persisted

---

### Kubernetes
# ReplicaSets

* Primitive resource
* Ensures desired amount of pods are always running
* Managed via Deployments

---

### Kubernetes
# Deployments

* High-level resource for configuring your application
* Responsible for pod creation via ReplicaSets
* Define scale (# of replicas)
* Define rollout strategy

---

### Kubernetes
# Services

* Expose pods to external clients
  * NodePort
  * LoadBalancer
* Expose pods internally
  * ClusterIP

---

### Kubernetes
# ConfigMaps & Secrets

* Key/value pairs for configuring your application
* Secrets are base64 encoded, can hold binary data
* Can be mounted as volumes and exposed as files

---

### Kubernetes
# Service Discovery

* DNS
  * `my-svc.my-namespace.svc.cluster.local`
* ENV
  * `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_HOST` and `{SVCNAME}_SERVICE_PORT`

# Introducing Minikube
### Kubernetes, on your laptop

> Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.
-- [kubernetes.io](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/minikube/)

---

### Minikube
# Getting Started

* Start your VM
  * `minikube start`
* Set Kubernetes context to minikube
  * `kubectl config use-context minikube`
* Use Minikube Docker server
  * `eval $(minikube docker-env)`
* Access the dashboard
  * `minikube dashboard`

---

### Minikube
# Things to note

* `imagePullPolicy: Never`
  * when using local docker images

---

### Minikube
# Show & Tell

---

### Kubernetes
# Accessing your running pods

* `kubectl exec`

---

### Elixir
# Remsh & Observer

* Gain access to your running application
* NOTE: [remsh is dangerous](https://www.broot.ca/erlang-remsh-is-dangerous)
  * Use `ssh` or `kubectl exec` for encryption in transit
  * Consider using an alternative to epmd

---

### Remsh & Observer
# Show & Tell

---

### Kubernetes
# Logs

`kubectl logs deployment/exonk8s -c exonk8s -f`

---

# Things to consider

* Graceful shutdown
  * Handling state when pods are replaced
  * Handling connections when pods are replaced

---
